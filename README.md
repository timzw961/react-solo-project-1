# My First solo project with React

Learnings:
1) If I decide to deploy with GH pages, I should create the app first through my own localhost, since each time I want to see an update, I have to commit to the branch and npm run deploy again, for each time. 
2) I need to get more comfortable with styling.

This digital business card will also be the basis for my group project (CSIT321). What I mean by this is that my group, WAKYN, will probably use these digital business cards in our own company website. We haven't started it yet, but I already told them the idea that each of group members (5 including myself) will complete the 2 hour react course at least to be able to create this card. Then, we'll try to implement it into our own group company website "see the team" page.
