# My First solo project with React

Learnings:
1) If I decide to deploy with GH pages, I should create the app first through my own localhost, since each time I want to see an update, I have to commit to the branch and npm run deploy again, for each time. 
2) I need to get more comfortable with styling.

I need to update this so it will fit different screen sizes.
-- Also need to add links to linked in, email, github, etc
